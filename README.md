# Transformers
A Unity package to run pretrained transformer models with Unity Sentis

[OpenUPM] · [Documentation (coming soon)] · [Feedback/Questions]

## About

This package is meant to be used together with the [com.doji.diffusers] package to enable running Stable Diffusion models in Unity.

It is intended to be a C# port of Hugging Face’s [transformers] library. As of today, the only implementation available is:
- a CLIPTokenizer
- tokenizer base classes
